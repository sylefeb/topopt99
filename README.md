# topopt99
A simple, easily hackable topopt code in C/C++

This code is directly inspired from the fantastic introductory paper:

*A 99 line topology optimization code written in MATLAB*<br>
Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization 21(2), 2001, pp. 120-127<br>
by Ole Sigmund.

I re-implemented it in C/C++ using LibSL-small and Eigen. I am sharing it for educational purposes as I found it very helpful as a starting point to play with topology optimization and build an intuition on how it actually works.<br>

And yes, it takes more than 99 lines of C/C++ ;-)
